00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,590
-LAF  -对  他们势力不小
- LAF? - Yeah, they're high-powered.

17
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,040
万桑特的飞机刚起飞
We lost contact with Vasant's plane

18
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,670
就跟我们失联了
just after it took off.

19
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,750
我们需要你确保
We need you to make sure

20
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,080
LAF不能落实他们的威胁
that LAF doesn't deliver on their threat.

万桑特的飞机已飞入了突尼斯领空

And Sam, this has to be subtle.

29
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,340
低调  知道了
Subtle. Got it.

30

00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,410
{\an2}他就像条鱼  是吧

46
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,420
{\an2}或许我们该在这里给他开膛

47

继续  我们就到了
Keep going! We're close!

53
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,480

If we get to the border, he's not gonna follow.

54
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,700

59
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,000
看来这是个问题咯
And I assume they have a problem with that.

60
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,700
是啊  大问题呢

66

我跟空军合作六个月了
I've been working with the Air Force for six months now.

76
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,640
每次有行动人员碰它  它就出毛病
Every time ops touches him, he gets all glitchy.

77
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,130

跟不上十亿个返回IP地址

85
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,600
他还会阿拉伯语
He knows Arabic.

86
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,720
你可以再说一遍吗  等等
Wait, can you say that again? Hold on a sec.

87
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,990
行了你
All right. Come on.

88
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:01,670
反正  这些LAF的人
Anyway, these LAF crews, man,

89
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,540
他们想
they're tryin' to take

90
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,790
利用混乱局面牟利
advantage of all the chaos and make some money.

91
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,400
这我理解  但是...
And that I get, but there's...

92
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,640
哎呦  看
Oh, bam! Right there!

93
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,790
看到他们了吗  他们是你需要担心的人
You see these guys? They're guys you gotta worry about.

94
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,670
我总在留言板上碰到
I've been stumbling onto their manifestos

95
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,010
他们的宣言
on message boards.

96
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,460
他们自称碎旗者
They're called the Flag Smashers.

97
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,370
这是新潮流吗  坏人起烂名
Is that a new thing? Bad guys give themselves bad names.

98
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,440
还有比那个烂得多的呢
There's a lot worse names than that one.

99
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,770
但简单说  他们认为
But basically, they think

100
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,590
世界在"闪烁"期间更好
that the world was better during The Blip.

101
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,870
相信我  才不是的
Trust me, it wasn't.

102
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,360
相信我  每次一群人觉得事情好起来了
Trust me. Every time something gets better for one group,

103
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,830
另一群人就觉得变糟了
it gets worse for another.

104
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,980
是啊  基本上
Yeah. Essentially, these people,

105
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,670
这些人想要一个统一无国界的世界
they want a world that's unified without borders.

106
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:41,070
所以可以理解为什么很多人喜欢这个
So, you could see why a lot of people are into that.

107
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,480
是啊  但多留意
Yeah, but keep an eye on it.

108
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,670
如果真闹大了  就告诉我
If anything gets serious, you let me know.

109
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,390
当然  我...
No doubt. I'll... I'll, uh...

110
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,500
我会关注网上信息流
I'll track the online chatter,

111
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,270
看他们都说什么
see what they're saying. Yeah.

112
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,720
但我得问问你
I do gotta ask you, though,

113
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,950
因为网上
'cause online there's just

114
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,640
有很多关于史蒂夫的传言
been a lot of stuff about Steve, actually.

115
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,040
疯狂的阴谋论
Um, crazy, crazy conspiracy theories.

116
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,290
有些人
So, some people...

117
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,020
有些人认为
Some people, they think that

118
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,350
他在月球的秘密基地上
he's in a secret base on the moon

119
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,090
俯视着我们
looking down over us.

120
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,720
嗯  我可以保证
Yeah. Well, I can assure you,

121
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,060
你不必拿那些人当真
those people, you don't have to take seriously.

122
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,390
但你没...
But you didn't, like...

123
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,690
把他飞上月球吗
fly him to the moon?

124
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,340
没
Nah.

125
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,580
我就是得问问
Had to check.

126
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,510
我来吧
Oh, oh, I got you, man.

127
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:25,210
-谢谢  下次我请  -好
- Thanks. I'll get you back next time. - All right.

128
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,930
-那你去哪  -华盛顿
- So, where are you off to? - Washington.

129
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,870
你去那里干什么
What are you doin' there?

130
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,790
月球的事
Moon stuff.

131
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,780
{\an8}华盛顿特区

132
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,620
史蒂夫代表了我们所有人最好的一面
Steve represented the best in all of us.

133
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:48,980
勇敢  正直  保持希望
Courageous, righteous, hopeful.

134
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,430
而且他禁欲系的表情堪称一绝
And he mastered posing stoically.

135
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,810
世界永远改变了
The world has been forever changed.

136
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,550
几个月前
A few months ago,

137
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:05,750
数十亿人  在离开五年后重新现身
billions of people reappeared after five years away,

138
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,490
让世界陷入混乱
sending the world into turmoil.

139
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:13,500
我们需要新英雄
We need new heroes.

140
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,190
适合我们当下时代的英雄
Ones suited for the times we're in.

141
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,340
象征
Symbols...

142
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,770
其意义来自赋予它们意义的
are nothing without the women and men

143
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,270
男男女女
that give them meaning.

144
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,170
这玩意
And this thing...

145
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,360
恐怕没有比它更伟大的象征了
I don't know if there's ever been a greater symbol.

146
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,620
但更重要的是持着它的男人
But it's more about the man who propped it up,

147
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,490
他不在了
and he's gone.

148
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,250
所以今天  我们向史蒂夫的遗志致敬
So, today we honor Steve's legacy.

149
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,940
但也看向未来
But also, we look to the future.

150
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,810
谢谢你  美国队长
So, thank you, Captain America.

151
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,910
但这是你的
But this belongs to you.

152
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,690
再次感谢你拿出盾牌  山姆
Thanks again for coming forward with the shield, Sam.

153
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,360
这是正确的决定
It was the right decision.

154
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:30,970
走走啊
Take a walk?

155
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,490
嗯  我一直在家
Yeah, I've been at home.

156
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,170
我姐姐和外甥
My sister and my nephews, man.

157
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,530
我离开时  他们还小
When I left, they were babies.

158
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,770
我回来时  他们都是小男子汉了
I come back and they're little men.

159
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,530
-真疯狂  -是啊
- It's crazy, you know? - Yeah.

160
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,330
你改天该带他们来特区
Well, you should bring 'em out to D.C. Sometime.

161
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,890
我可以教他们飞
I'll teach 'em how to fly.

162
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,250
正确的飞行方式
You know, I mean, the right way.

163
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,290
今后不会有人持那块盾了  真不可思议
Crazy that nobody's gonna be carryin' the shield.

164
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,920
史蒂夫被封在在冰层那七十年来
Hey, we went for 70 years without anybody carryin' it

165
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,240
这盾牌都无人持有
when Steve was on ice.

166
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,620
所以我们不会有问题的
So, I think we'll be all right.

167
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,330
时过境迁了  山姆
That was a different time, Sam.

168
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:08,120
{\an8}最后一次任务
失踪者

169
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,140
看来你是非要我问出来啊
I see you're gonna make me ask.

170
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,620
你为什么没继承衣钵
Why didn't you take up the mantle?

171
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,890
史蒂夫第一次跟我说起盾牌的时候
When Steve first told me about the shield,

172
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,760
我说的第一句话是
the first words I said were,

173
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,900
"感觉是别人的"
"It feels like it belongs to someone else."

174
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,320
"别人"就是史蒂夫
That someone else is Steve.

175
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,910
{\an8}美国队长
我要你立即买战争债券
我宣誓忠诚  并对战争保持沉默

176
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,960
现在全世界都疯了
World's a crazy place right now.

177
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,620
人们...
People are...

178
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,580
没人靠得住
Well, nobody's stable.

179
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,820
盟友现在是敌人
Allies are now enemies.

180
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,950
同盟被撕裂了
Alliances are all torn apart.

181
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,100
世界破碎了
The world's broken.

182
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,060
所有人都盼着能有人来修复它
Everybody's just looking for somebody to fix it.

183
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,180
是啊
Yeah.

184
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,740
现在是新时代了  兄弟
It's a new day, brother.

185
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,500
回头再联系
I'll be in touch.

186
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,380
谢谢
I mean... Thank you.

187
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,590
-了了一桩事  -是啊
- Oh... Well, that's done. - Yeah.

188
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,650
酒吧打烊前一起去喝个半小时
Half hour before last call?

189
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,870
不行  各位  我得准备明天的会议
I can't, guys. I have to prep for tomorrow's session.

190
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,960
-真的吗  -你...
- Really? - You...

191
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,250
九头蛇万岁
Hail HYDRA.

192
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,330
糟了
Shit.

193
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:54,830
求你了
Please.

194
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,030
我什么都没看见
I didn't see anything.

195
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,140
我什么都没看见
I didn't see anything.

196
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,200
我什么都没看见
I didn't see anything.

197
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,250
巴恩斯先生  你现在仍然常做噩梦吗
So, Mr. Barnes, are you still having nightmares?

198
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,730
詹姆斯  我问你话呢
James, I asked you a question.

199
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,520
你现在仍然常做噩梦吗
Are you still having nightmares?

200
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,520
没有
No.

201
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,230
我们已经做了那么多次咨询了
We've been doing this long enough

202
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,020
你撒谎我能看出来
that I can tell when you're lying.

203
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,560
你今天状态有些不对
Well, you seem a little off today.

204
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,950
最近出了什么事吗
Did something happen recently?

205
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,400
没有
No.

206
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,150
你现在是平民了
You're a civilian now.

207
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,170
鉴于你的过去
With your history,

208
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:47,830
政府需要知道你不会...
the government needs to know that you're not gonna...

209
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,280
这是赦免你的一个条件
It's a condition of your pardon.

210
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,550
给我讲讲你最近做的噩梦
So, tell me about your most recent nightmare.

211
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,450
我没做噩梦
I didn't have a nightmare.

212
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,250
拜托  真要这样吗
Oh, come on. Really?

213
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,290
你要给我记一笔吗
You're gonna do the notebook thing?

214
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,650
为什么  这叫消极对抗
Why? It's passive aggressive.

215
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,460
你不开口  我就只能写了
You don't talk. I write.

216
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,730
好吧  好吧
Okay. Okay.

217
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,840
我昨天从我的赎罪名单上划掉了一个名字
I crossed a name off the list of my amends yesterday.

218
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:24,290
别担心  你的三条规则我都有遵守
Don't worry. I used all your three rules.

219
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,330
阿特伍德参议员
Senator Atwood.

220
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,100
她当了好多年九头蛇的爪牙
She was a HYDRA pawn for years.

221
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,820
我还是冬兵的时候  协助她当选参议员
Helped her get into office when I was the Winter Soldier.

222
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,890
九头蛇解散之后
And after HYDRA disbanded,

223
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:43,090
她继续滥用我给她的权力
she continued to abuse the power I gave her.

224
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,440
摆平这件事
Make this go away.

225
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,550
要是洛克哈特众议员想发声
If Congressman Lockhart wants to speak up,

226
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:51,550
就让他永远闭嘴
silence him for good.

227
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:56,410
第一条规则  你不许做违法的事
So, rule number one, you can't do anything illegal.

228
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,760
怎么回事
What the hell?

229
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,560
我不过是提供了一些能定她罪的情报而已
All I did was give some intel to the aide to convict her.

230
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,950
其他的我一概没参与
And I wasn't involved in anything else.

231
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,290
第二条规则呢
Rule number two?

232
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,280
第二条规则是什么
What was rule number two?

233
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,970
不许让任何人受伤  这很重要
Nobody gets hurt. It's a big one.

234
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,820
那它怎么不是第一条
Then why isn't it rule number one?

235
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,530
我没伤害任何人
I didn't hurt anybody.

236
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,850
动一动啊
Come on!

237
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,480
记得我吗
Remember me?

238
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,220
我保证没有伤人
I promise.

239
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,990
那第三条规则呢
And what about rule number three?

240
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,360
赎罪补过
The whole point of making amends

241
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,340
就是为了实现第三条规则
is to fulfill rule number three.

242
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,010
你太不信任人了  医生
You know, you're a cynic, Doc.

243
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,610
我当然完成了第三条
Of course, I completed rule number three.

244
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,290
我已经不是冬日战士了
I am no longer the Winter Soldier.

245
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,740
我是詹姆斯·布坎南·巴恩斯
I am James Bucky Barnes...

246
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,560
你是我努力赎罪的一部分
And you're part of my efforts to make amends.

247
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,660
你都做得很好
So, you did it all right,

248
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,310
但却没能改善做噩梦的情况
but it didn't help with the nightmares.

249
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,720
我说了  我没做噩梦
Well, like I said, I didn't have any.

250
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,030
听着
Look...

251
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,360
总有一天你得敞开心扉
one day, you're gonna have to open up

252
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,350
你得明白有些人是真心想帮你
and understand that some people really do want to help you

253
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,060
他们是可以信赖的
and that they can be trusted.

254
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,270
我信赖人们
I trust people.

255
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,820
是吗  手机给我
Yeah? Give me your phone.

256
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,010
你这上面连十个联系人都没有
You don't have ten phone numbers on this thing.

257
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:37,390
你还一直无视山姆的短信
Oh, and you've been ignoring the texts from Sam.

258
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,700
听我说  你得培养友情
Look, you've gotta nurture friendships.

259
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,620
你一整周只给我一个人打过电话
I am the only person you have called all week.

260
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,390
太可悲了
That is so sad.

261
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,320
你孤身一人
You're alone.

262
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,740
你已经一百多岁了
You're a hundred years old.

263
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,170
你没有过去  没有家人
You have no history, no family...

264
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,070
你是在抨击我吗  医生
Are you lashing out at me, Doc?

265
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,050
这可太不专业了  知道吗
Because that's really unprofessional, you know?

266
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,430
你什么时候开始玩这招了  吼你的病人
I mean, when did that start? Yelling at your clients?

267
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,640
又拿出记事本了  漂亮
The notebook. That's great.

268
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,220
好吧  放我一马  我在努力了  好吗
All right, give me a break. I'm trying, okay?

269
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,570
这不是...
This isn't...

270
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,340
这对我来说是新体验
This is new for me.

271
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,840
我以前从没有时间去处理自己任何事  好吗
I didn't have a moment to deal with anything, you know?

272
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,190
我在瓦坎达...
I had a little...

273
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,370
有过短暂的平静
calm in Wakanda.

274
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,390
除此之外
And other than that,

275
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:22,370
我整整90年都在一场接一场地战斗
I just went from one fight to another for 90 years.

276
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,730
现在你不用战斗了
So, now that you've stopped fighting,

277
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,110
你想要什么
what do you want?

278
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,040
安宁
Peace.

279
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,310
完全是扯淡
That is utter bullshit.

280
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,790
你这心理医生当得也太糟了
You're a terrible shrink.

281
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,790
我以前是名优秀的士兵
I was an excellent soldier,

282
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,310
我见过许多死尸
so I saw a lot of dead bodies,

283
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,860
我知道那能让人封闭自我
and I know how that can shut you down.

284
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,420
如果你还孤身一人
And if you are alone,

285
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,310
那就是最安静  最孤独的地狱
that is the quietest, most personal hell.

286
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,050
而且  詹姆斯  你很难逃离 
And, James, it is very hard to escape.

287
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,440
听着  我知道你经历了很多
Look, I know that you have been through a lot,

288
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:07,240
可你找回了自己的意志
but you've got your mind back,

289
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,530
你得到了赦免
you are being pardoned.

290
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:12,410
这些都是好事
I mean, these are good things.

291
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,270
你自由了
You're free.

292
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,970
我可以做什么
To do what?

293
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,740
{\an8}纽约  布鲁克林区

294
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,630
怎么了  怎么了
What? What?

295
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,150
你那箱连一半都没满  我们一起用不行吗
Your can isn't even half full. Why don't we just share?

296
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,570
-说什么蠢话呢  -没必要推我吧  优里
- What are you talking about? - You don't gotta body me, Yori.

297
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,660
-叫我中岛先生  -行
- It's Mr. Nakajima. - Okay.

298
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,370
-中岛先生  -知道了  中岛先生
- Mr. Nakajima! - Okay. Mr. Nakajima.

299
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,830
优里  怎么了  我们不是要去吃午饭吗
Yori, what's goin' on? I thought we're getting lunch.

300
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,340
优尼克要把他的垃圾丢到我的垃圾箱里
Unique is putting his trash into my trash.

301
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,020
都是垃圾啊
It's trash.

302
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,860
我该揍烂你的...
And the time has come for me to smack...

303
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,040
-只是垃圾而已  -别激动
- It's just trash. - Hang on.

304
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,030
你好  我是优尼克
Hey, man. I'm Unique.

305
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,630
莫尼克的"尼克"  但是有个"优"  代表优秀
It's like Monique, but it's got a "U" in there for uniqueness.

306
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,710
-鬼扯  -好了  抱歉
- That's absurd. - Okay, sorry.

307
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,590
优里  你不能老跟邻居们干架
Yori, you can't keep fighting with your neighbors.

308
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,420
-走吧  我们去吃东西  -不  你走开
- Come on, let's get some food. - No, go away.

309
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,440
异滋啊  我们周三都要去异滋吃饭的
But Izzy. We always go to Izzy on Wednesday.

310
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,950
-我今天没心情  -要是我请客呢
- I'm not in the mood today. - Hey, what if I buy?

311
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:12,500
行吧  但是不聊天
Fine, but no talking.

312
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:15,100
看看
Take a look.

313
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,370
这周去世的人都没撑过90岁
Nobody made it past 90 this week.

314
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,880
这么年轻  真可惜
So young. Such a shame.

315
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,990
你们没点平时吃的那些
You guys didn't order the usual, huh?

316
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,820
是想来点冒险吗
Feeling a little adventurous?

317
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,330
你该约她出去
You should ask her out.

318
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:35,000
他想跟你约会
He would like to take you out on a date.

319
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,490
去玩宾果游戏或者打牌怎么样
Maybe to bingo or a night of pinochle?

320
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,550
扑克牌
Pinochle.

321
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:42,360
-我替他道歉  -不用道歉
- I'm really sorry about him. - Why are you sorry?

322
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,840
我愿意去啊
I'm game.

323
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,320
-那明天晚上行吗  -可以
- Tomorrow night, then? - Tomorrow night's great.

324
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,340
但能不能别玩扑克牌
Just maybe not pinochle.

325
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,480
-扑克牌不好吗  -是呀
- What's wrong with pinochle? - Yeah.

326
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,090
我明晚要上班
I have a shift,

327
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,050
如果你想过来的话  我大概十点能结束
but if you wanna come back here, I should be done around 10:00.

328
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,560
你刚才竟然这么做
I can't believe you did that.

329
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,920
约会就像跳舞
It's a dance to these things.

330
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:06,210
不能...  得先热身  我1943年后就没跳过舞了
You can't... You gotta warm up and I haven't danced since 1943...

331
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,530
感觉有那么久
it feels like.

332
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,080
怎么了
What's wrong?

333
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:19,330
{\an2}我儿子

334
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,300
{\an2}他最爱吃红豆大福了

335
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:32,670
他那时在一家咨询公司工作
He had a job with a consulting company.

336
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:39,020
在外国出差的时候遇害了
And, uh, he was working abroad and he was killed.

337
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,980
警察说是他不凑巧出现在那里  但是
The police said "Wrong place, wrong time," but...

338
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:47,630
我永远都无法知道真相
I will never know what really happened to him.

339
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,920
事情并不简单
I felt it was strange.

340
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:53,780
直觉告诉我
In here.

341
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,760
{\an8}路易斯安那州  德拉克洛瓦

342
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:34,890
这个也要吗  妈妈
This, too, Mom?

343
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,360
是的  全部都要  宝贝
Yeah, all of it, baby.

344
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,520
{\an8}威尔逊海鲜

345
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,630
那个要送到施粥场
And we're taking that one to the soup kitchen.

346
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,380
放在那边就好
So, put that one over there.

347
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,980
蓝桶装鲷鱼  橙桶装白鲑鱼
Blue for the snapper, orange for the whitefish.

348
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,300
山姆舅舅
Uncle Sam!

349
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:47,830
你们好吗
What's up?

350
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,780
说得很对
That's right!

351
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:53,260
山姆舅舅  你提早回来了
Uncle Sam, you're back early.

352
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:57,360
怎么了  你露出了跟妈妈一样的滑头表情
What's goin' on? You got Mom's sneaky look on your face.

353
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,450
你哪能猜到我在想什么
How you gonna try to read me

354
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,560
你明知道我才最能看透你
when you know I'm the one that reads you?

355
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:06,680
{\an8} 保罗和达琳号

356
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,640
真令人惊叹
You gotta marvel at it.

357
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,060
这艘船仅靠强力胶布和祈祷撑了这么久
Baby being held together by duct tape and prayers.

358
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:08,900
没事的
It'll be fine.

359
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,600
只要能浮在水上  撑到我把它卖掉就行
It just needs to float long enough for me to sell it.

360
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,940
我们不是说好了先商量再决定卖不卖吗
I thought we were gonna discuss if we were selling it.

361
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,830
我们商量过了
We did.

362
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,940
然后你就去跟什么太空披风博士打架了
And then you were off fighting Doctor Space Cape or whatever

363
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,090
我好不容易维持了它五年
while I was holdin' it together for five long years.

364
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,340
现在世界已经重回正轨
Now that the world is going back to normal,

365
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,500
我该卖掉它了
this thing's gotta go.

366
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,450
我们是在这艘船上长大的
We grew up on this thing.

367
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,110
它的意义不止爸爸妈妈的名字  莎拉
It's not just Mom and Dad's name on it, Sarah.

368
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,980
这是我们家的一部分
This thing is a part of our family.

369
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,420
你知道我们现在什么处境
You know the situation we're in.

370
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:34,680
所以我不愿意在大家面前多说
This is why I prefer not to dwell on it in front of everybody.

371
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,930
如果我们不用卖掉它呢
Well, what if we don't have to sell it?

372
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,200
能跟你私下谈谈吗
Can I talk to you?

373
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,110
-怎么样呀  山姆  -你好吗
- What's good, Big Sam? - What's goin' on, man?

374
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,710
-想像你一样潇洒呀  -可不是嘛
- I'm trying to live like you. - You know it.

375
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,610
-又要去拯救世界了吗  -没有
- Off to save the world again? - Nah.

376
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,530
得了吧  卡洛斯  我比你还常待在这里
Come on, Carlos. I'm around here more than you.

377
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:48,860
我就是新奥尔兰的代表人物
I'm always reppin' NOLA.

378
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,020
什么时候把翅膀借我玩玩啊
When you gonna let me borrow the wings, man?

379
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:53,900
等你把欠我姐的一百块还了就借给你
As soon as you give my sister back that $100 you borrowed.

380
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,860
太无情了  再借我五十吧
That's cold. Now, loan me a hot $50.

381
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,330
好啊  再借你五十
Yeah. I'll loan you $50.

382
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,030
-山姆  我一定要把船卖掉  -等等
- Sam, the boat's gotta go. - Wait.

383
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,710
不  让我说完
No, let me finish.

384
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,910
我已经竭尽所能去维持生意了
I'm doin' everything I can to keep this business afloat.

385
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:13,300
但是我们每天入不敷出
And every day I'm making $5, and spending $10.

386
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,410
-那你为什么不让我帮忙  -别说了
- So, why won't you let me help? - No, don't start with that.

387
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,300
爸爸去世前我们说好的
We made a deal before Daddy died.

388
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,550
你出去闯荡  我按我的方式打理生意
You're out there. I do things my way here.

389
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,150
对  但是你借钱的时候
Right. But you tangled the house into this

390
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,990
把房子抵进去了
when you took those loans.

391
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,650
忘了你打人有多疼了
Forgot how hard you hit.

392
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,890
莎拉
Sarah!

393
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,170
听我说  别再打我了
Look, and don't hit me again.

394
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,900
如果你有钱翻修船呢
What if you had money to fix it up,

395
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,130
弄得漂亮点  这样你不出海的时候
make it nice so you can charter it

396
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,530
就可以租出去了
when you're not out working the waters?

397
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:41,430
你知道对我来说
Do you know how hard it was

398
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,630
向现实低头有多难吗
for me to come to terms with the situation?

399
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,340
你为什么要旧事重提
Why would you dig this up?

400
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:49,520
我们可以贷款  好好加固一番
We can take a loan and consolidate everything.

401
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,410
这能减少你每月的花销
It'll take down your monthly.

402
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:54,480
-笑什么  -你以为我没试过银行这条路吗
- What? - You think I didn't try the banks?

403
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,190
他们做的都是大生意
They're in with all that big business.

404
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,840
确实  但现在你有我帮你了
Yeah. But now you have me.

405
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,220
别这样  山姆
Don't, Sam.

406
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,950
-我现在才刚有起色  -好吧
- I just got good with this. - All right.

407
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,790
也许我们都应该向前看了
Maybe it is time for us to move on.

408
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,860
无论如何  让我帮你吧
Either way, just let me help.

409
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,660
我来安排会面
I'll set the appointment.

410
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,580
我不会让你失望的  我们可以扭转局面
Look, I won't let you down. We can turn this shit around.

411
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,840
相信我
Trust me.

412
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,390
能救人于水火吗
To the rescue?

413
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,830
随时随地
Always.

414
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,620
我们吃晚饭吧  我饿了
Now, let's get some dinner. I'm hungry.

415
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,910
这可真是我见过最可爱
Well, if that's not the most adorably

416
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:54,170
但又老套的举动了
old-fashioned thing anyone's ever done.

417
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:02,350
随便坐吧  我马上就弄完了
Grab a seat, I'll be done in a few.

418
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,540
好
Okay.

419
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,480
消失的那一半人回来后  你常去约会吗
So, have you dated much since half the fish in the sea came back?

420
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,400
基本没有
Not really.

421
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,360
我...
I, um...

422
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,560
尝试了网上约会的那一套
tried the whole online dating thing.

423
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,500
太疯狂了
It's pretty crazy.

424
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,870
我看到了好多奇怪的照片
A lot of weird pictures.

425
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:23,590
什么样的奇怪照片
What kind of weird?

426
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:26,810
比如  老虎的照片什么的
I mean, tiger photos?

427
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,820
有时候我都看不懂那些照片
Half the time I don't even know what I'm looking at. It's...

428
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,360
很难理解
It's a lot.

429
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,180
你说话口气和我爸一样
You sound like my dad.

430
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,320
等一下  你多大了
Wait, how old are you?

431
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,840
106岁
A hundred and six.

432
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,530
你怎么总戴着手套
What's up with your gloves?

433
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,910
我...
I, um...

434
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,390
我的
have, uh...

435
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,270
血液循环不太好
Poor circulation.

436
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,100
-我们玩游戏吧  -好的
- Let's play a game. - Yeah.

437
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,620
-你喜欢玩游戏吗  -超喜欢
- You like games? - Love 'em.

438
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,620
有时上班太无聊  我们偶尔玩一会儿
We keep some games around for boring shifts.

439
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,590
我去拿点啤酒
I'll go grab a couple of beers.

440
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,500
你在干什么
What are you doing?

441
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,520
我在读你的思想
I'm reading your mind.

442
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,540
求你别这样
Please don't.

443
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:26,120
B8  完蛋了吧
B-8, sucker.

444
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,420
猜中了
Uh, hit!

445
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:32,140
喝酒  赶快喝
Drink! Come on, drink.

446
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,560
好吧  我喝
All right. Okay.

447
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,850
你酒量不错啊
Wow, you really can drink.

448
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,180
算是吧
Yeah, well...

449
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,830
你有兄弟姐妹吗
Do you have any siblings?

450
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,940
我有一个妹妹  F4
I have a sister. F-4.

451
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,510
没猜中  喝酒
Miss. Drink.

452
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,640
你和你父母关系好吗
Are you close with your parents?

453
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:47,680
以前挺好
I was.

454
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,610
他们去世了
They passed away.

455
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,720
D5
Um, D-5.

456
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,210
我很遗憾
Oh, I'm sorry.

457
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,290
没猜中
Um, miss.

458
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:59,970
我觉得你很好心  愿意陪优里
I think it's really sweet you're spending time with Yori.

459
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,830
他儿子去世以后  他过得很不好
It's been hard for him his son died.

460
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:08,730
对他来说  最难以接受的就是不知道死因
I think not knowing how it happened is the hardest part for him.

461
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,350
这让他真的很崩溃
Mmm, it really messed him up.

462
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:16,260
如果一个人妻子去世  他会被叫做鳏夫
You know how you call a guy whose wife died a widower?

463
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,450
如果失去父母  你就是孤儿
Or, if your parents die, you're an orphan.

464
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:24,860
但却没有一个词来称呼失去孩子的父母
You know, there's no word for someone whose kids die.

465
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,200
因为这是最痛苦的事情
Because it's the worst thing that could happen.

466
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,630
抱歉  我先走了
Yeah, excuse me.

467
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,350
你还好吗
You good?

468
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:45,540
你来干什么
Hey, what are you doing here?

469
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,670
你约会得怎么样了
How was the date?

470
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,540
还...还行
It was... It was good.

471
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,010
我忘记把午饭钱还给你了
Forgot I owed you for lunch.

472
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,960
{\an8}中岛

473
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,970
好了
There we go.

474
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:34,440
帮忙递下饭盒  盛饭  快点
Get the plates moving. Get some rice in there. Come on.

475
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,380
摆得真整齐
Oh, lined up perfectly.

476
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,960
你就爱干这些没用的事
You always gotta do the most, huh?

477
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,420
我跟银行那些白人打交道可不含糊
You know I don't play with these White folks.

478
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:42,150
听着  我知道你很担心
Look, I know you're worried, all right?

479
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:44,630
但我研究过了  计算过
But I did the research. I ran the numbers.

480
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,140
-你觉得这样能行吗  -我知道能行
- You think this is gonna work? - I know it will.

481
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,420
然后我们就能翻新厨房了
And then we can renovate the kitchen.

482
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:52,810
你说你想周末卖吃的  对吗
Now, you said you wanted to sell plates on the weekends, right?

483
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:56,330
那很好啊  你可以采用奶奶的食谱
That's great. You can introduce some of Grandma's recipes and...

484
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:58,160
糟了  我们得出发了
Shit. We gotta go.

485
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,350
急什么  离约定时间还有一小时
Wait, the appointment's in an hour.

486
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,900
没有准时到这回事
There's no such thing as on time.

487
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,800
不是到早了就是到晚了  你选一个
You're either early or late. Pick one.

488
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:07,420
好吧  现在你真是没事找事了
Okay. Now you're really doing more than the most.

489
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,050
孩子们  我爱你们
All right, boys, I love you.

490
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:14,110
刘先生会照看你们  不准打电动
Now, Mr. Liu's gonna watch over you and no video games.

491
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,860
-爱你哦  再见  -再见
- Love you. Bye. - Bye.

492
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,850
可以打电动啦
Yes, video games.

493
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,530
三  二  一
Three, two, one.

494
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,030
冲冲冲
Go, go, go!

495
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,150
{\an8}瑞士

496
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,240
{\an8}目的地
加塞尔银行

497
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,070
{\an2}你知道我们要做什么吗

498
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:15,830
{\an8}跑

499
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,480
{\an8}加塞尔银行

500
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:33,470
{\an2}钱在他手上

501
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,780
{\an2}你被捕了

502
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,920
他要逃走了
He's getting away!

503
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:49,190
抱歉
Sorry. Uh...

504
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,310
{\an2}对不起

505
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:03,180
我不懂这里的抓人程序
I don't know how jurisdiction works here,

506
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:05,340
但我得宣布逮捕你
but I'mma have to place you under arrest.

507
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:32,190
抱歉  我一直在想  你是不是给路大打过球
Sorry, I keep thinking. Did you used to play for LSU?

508
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,030
我是不是在哪里见过你
Do I know you from somewhere?

509
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,480
我不知道  有吗
I don't know. Do you?

510
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,700
肯定有  但在哪里呢
I do. But where?

511
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,050
还想不起来吗
Come on.

512
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,990
-我知道了  猎鹰  -没错
- I knew it. Falcon! - Yeah!

513
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:47,010
就是嘛  兄弟
Yes! Yes! Man! Oh...

514
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:49,350
我刚才不想提起
I didn't want to say anything. You know...

515
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,330
我以前一直想成为复仇者
I always wanted to be an Avenger.

516
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:54,540
这就是梦想成真  你知道吗
Oh, man, it's a dream come true, you know?

517
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:55,240
太棒了
That's amazing.

518
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,030
转型为捕鱼和租赁公司
Like, keeping my family's business afloat

519
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:59,630
让我们的家族生意得以维持下去
by changin' to a fishin' and charter model.

520
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:02,600
我一直很好奇  你们靠什么谋生
I've always wondered... How do you guys make a living?

521
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,150
其他英雄还是
Those guys or the guy

522
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:06,050
坐在你面前想借钱的这一位
sitting in front of you tryin' to get a loan?

523
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,370
都想知道
Both.

524
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,830
你的财务状况一团糟
I mean, your financials are all over the place.

525
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,510
英雄有特别经费吗
Is there some kind of fund for heroes?

526
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,420
还是说斯塔克在世时会付薪水给你们
Or did Stark pay you when he was around?

527
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,910
对了  节哀顺变
My condolences, by the way.

528
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:17,240
谢谢  没有  不是那样的
Thank you, but no, it doesn't really work like that.

529
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:21,210
这世界有很多好心人  因此
There's a tremendous amount of goodwill and because of that,

530
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,140
大家愿意帮忙
people are inclined to help,

531
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,560
-这些钱都会用到日常开支  -这样啊
- which applies to the business. - Yeah, right.

532
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,010
但你这段时间都是靠捐款生活吗
But were you living off of goodwill this whole time?

533
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,170
我不知道你问这些干什么
I don't get what you're going for here.

534
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:33,270
你是想帮我们还是想告我们
Are you trying to help us, or indict us?

535
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,220
过去五年你都没有收入
You have no income over the last five years.

536
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:38,220
不存在的人何来收入
How can you have income if you don't exist?

537
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,370
莎拉
Sarah.

538
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:47,350
我和其他几十亿人一样  消失了一段时间
I've been gone like several billion other people.

539
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,230
但假如你仔细看我们的计划
But if you look at our plan,

540
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:51,980
我是政府合同工  所以那是收入证明
I have government contracts, so, that's proof of earnings.

541
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:55,120
我知道我们有资格申请小型企业贷款
And I know for a fact that we qualify for a SBA loan.

542
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,220
按以前的条款  是的
Under the old terms, sure.

543
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,800
但现在  因为很多人突然出现
But these days, what, with everyone just showing up,

544
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,190
所以门槛提高了
well, things tightened up.

545
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:05,140
有意思  我们总遇到不利局面
Funny how things always tighten around us.

546
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:09,000
别激动  我站在你们这边  毕竟他是英雄
Easy there. Look, I'm on your side. After all, he's a hero.

547
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,890
你能不能展开翅膀  跟我合照
Is there any chance, and you could say "no,"

548
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,770
你可以拒绝的
that I could get a selfie with your arms out?

549
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:15,300
你在搞笑吗
Are you serious?

550
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:21,070
威尔逊先生  威尔逊太太
Mr. Wilson, Mrs. Wilson...

551
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:23,220
是女士  我是寡妇
Miss. I'm a widow.

552
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,170
威尔逊女士
Ms. Wilson.

553
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:29,080
我知道你们家族世代都把钱存在我们银行
I know your family has banked with us for generations,

554
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:31,120
但我们无法批准
but we cannot approve you.

555
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,910
我真的很抱歉
I'm truly sorry.

556
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,450
我们一定要搞到这笔贷款
We're gonna get that loan.

557
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,640
哪怕得跑遍全城的银行
I don't care if I have to go to every bank in the city.

558
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,210
山姆  别费劲了  我不想再烦这些事了
Sam, stop! I don't want to deal with this again.

559
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:46,900
人生就是要烦各种事
That's what life is, dealing with things.

560
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,890
你没资格说这种话
You are so out of pocket for that.

561
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:50,160
别忘了  你加入了空军
Don't forget, you joined the Air Force.

562
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,650
你没有看到爸爸和妈妈是怎么过来的
You didn't see everything Mom and Daddy dealt with.

563
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,300
我早就知道他们不会帮我们  这不属他们的职责
I knew they weren't gonna help us. It's not their job.

564
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,700
这些人根本不了解爸爸  他曾是个大人物
Those people don't know who Daddy was, and he was a giant.

565
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,520
我不在乎  我不会放弃的
I don't care. I'm not gonna quit.

566
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,180
你想证明什么  你想证明给谁看
What are you trying to prove? And who you trying to prove it to?

567
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,770
-我发誓  爸爸死后...  -我就知道你会提这茬
- I swear, after Daddy died... - I knew that was gonna come up.

568
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,140
我有想法可不会藏着
I never hid what I thought.

569
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:10,010
你非得离家  去和军队与怪物战斗
You had to go off and fight armies and monsters.

570
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,080
我很敬重你
And I appreciate that,

571
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,790
但你不能因为之前不在这帮家里度过难关
but you don't get to come back here and try to right your wrongs

572
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:16,780
就想回来弥补你的过错
just because you couldn't deal with what was going on here.

573
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,430
你根本不知道这五年来发生了什么
You don't know what happened these last five years.

574
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:22,490
我一个人带着两个孩子撑到了现在
I was alone with two babies and I survived.

575
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,330
是我苦苦支撑着  那艘船才没沉
I'm the one who kept that boat from sinkin'.

576
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:27,230
那艘船有一半是我的  这座房子也是
Yeah, well, half the boat's mine and so is the house.

577
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,240
我们不能卖掉我们家的遗产
We're not sellin' our family's legacy.

578
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,350
你明知我是对的却非要犟吗
You gonna do me like that when you know I'm right?

579
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,390
没错
Yep!

580
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,620
好吧
Okay.

581
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,850
来吧  宝贝  看看你的本事
Come on, baby. What you got for me?

582
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,640
拜托  拜托
Come on! Come on!

583
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,270
该死
Shit!

584
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:28,280
{\an8}转到安全线路  我需要你看点东西  马上给我回电#紧急

585
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:40,640
这就是碎旗者的领导者吗
So, this is the leader of the Flag Smashers, huh?

586
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,320
是的  人很不错
Yeah, real nice guy.

587
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,120
你不是应该在线上监控他们吗
I thought you were supposed to be monitoring them online.

588
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,610
是的  我监控了
I was. I did.

589
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,170
但有时候就是得干点脏活
But you know sometimes you gotta get your hands dirty,

590
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:51,010
或者被打破眼眶
or a broken orbital.

591
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,950
你该庆幸才受了这点伤
You're lucky that's all you got.

592
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,130
他力气很大
He's strong.

593
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:57,640
的确  他们在一切结束后马上销声匿迹
He was. I mean, bro, they went dark as soon as it was all over.

594
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,390
这是他们的惯用手法
But that's their M.O.

595
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:01,640
我们得保持警惕  等他们下次再出现
We gotta keep our eyes and ears to the ground till they pop up again.

596
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,430
除了这段视频外还发生什么了吗
Anything else happen outside the video?

597
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:05,450
没有  我还不知道发生了什么
No, man. My face was in the dirt

598
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:07,280
就已经被击倒在地了
before I knew what was happening.

599
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:09,640
为什么这么问  你在想什么
Why? What are you thinking?

600
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,920
没什么
Nothin'.

601
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,280
等等  你不会觉得他是...
Wait. You don't think he could be a...

602
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,080
我回头找你
Look, I'll circle back to you.

603
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,860
-先别把这件事告诉别人  行吗  -好
- Let's keep this between me and you, okay? - All right.

604
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:22,550
天啊  山姆  你快来看
Oh, my God, Sam. You better look at this.

605
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:27,390
最近发生的一切让这里人心惶惶
Unrest, in the wake of recent events has left us vulnerable.

606
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:30,160
{\an8}突发新闻

607
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,170
美国人每天都能感受到
Every day Americans feel it.

608
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,810
我们爱戴那些
While we love heroes

609
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:35,030
为了保护地球出生入死的英雄们
who put their lives on the line to defend Earth,

610
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:38,120
但我们也需要能保卫这个国家的英雄
we also need a hero to defend this country.

611
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:40,400
我们需要一个
We need a real person

612
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,360
能体现美国卓越价值的人
who embodies America's greatest values.

613
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:48,490
我们需要一个能重新鼓舞我们的人
We need someone to inspire us again,

614
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,060
一个能象征我们所有人的人
someone who can be a symbol for all of us.

615
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:56,670
所以  我代表国防部
So, on behalf of the department of Defense

616
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:58,590
和我们的总司令
and our Commander-in-Chief,

617
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:02,110
今天在此荣幸地宣布
it is with great honor that we announce here today

618
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:06,880
美利坚合众国将迎来一名新英雄
that the United States of America has a new hero.

619
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:11,180
让我们一起欢迎新美国队长
Join me in welcoming your new Captain America.

620
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,980
